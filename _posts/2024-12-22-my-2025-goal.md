# My 2025 Goal - A Year of Game Development

If you've talked to me recently about my dreams, you may have heard me talk about **Corrupted Virtues**. A tactical, turn-based RPG I’ve dreamed of creating since I first started learning about hobby game development in 2019. But as a basically solo developer with limited time, I've learned the hard way diving straight into such a large project is unrealistic.

So, I’m giving myself **one year** – 2025 – to focus on learning, prototyping, and improving my game development skills. By the end of next year, I hope to have a solid foundation to potentially start my dream project in 2026.

I still plan to post every week in 2025 on my progress, but sinces it's still 2024 in this post, I’ll outline the systems I want to learn, the technical goals I’m setting, and how I plan to manage my time for **Moral Support Studios**.

## The Game I Want to Make

At its core, the **Corrupted Virtues** game I envision will feature:  
- **3D Grid-based Movement**
- **Turn-based Combat**  
- **Quick Time Events (QTE)**  
- **Equipment and Inventory Systems**  
- **Crafting and Currency**  
- **XP and Skill Progression**  
- **Party System**  
- **Dialogue and Storytelling**  
- **Distance-based Encounters**  
- **Save/Load Functionality**  

These systems are the foundation of many great RPGs, and while I know implementing all of them is ambitious, I believe starting small and iterating will help me achieve this goal over time.  

## Long-Term Goals (Post 2025)

Eventually, I’d love to explore:  
- **Sandbox Level Creation**  
- **PvP (Local and Online)**  
- **Team Creation Systems**  

These ideas will stay in the back of my mind but won’t be a focus for the next year.  

## Technical Focus for 2025  

From a technical standpoint, I want to:  
- Develop entirely in **Godot 4** using **C#**  
- Use **GitHub** for version control  
- Implement **unit tests**  
- Follow **Clean Code** and **Clean Architecture** principles  

This will help me not only build the game but ensure that the codebase is scalable and maintainable.  

## The Plan: Building a Prototype  

Instead of trying to make a full game immediately, I’m going to start with a **small, focused prototype**. By the end of 2025, I want to have a simple, working demo that includes:  
- **Grid-based movement**  
- **Turn-based combat**  
- **Basic inventory and equipment**  
- **XP and Skills**  
- **Save/Load functionality**  

Anything else is a bonus.  

## Breaking It Down – A Month-by-Month Approach  

I’ll break the year down into manageable chunks, focusing on one system at a time:  

### Q1 (Jan – Mar)  
- Improve my **Godot 4 C#** fundamentals  
- Implement **3D Grid-based movement**  
- Add basic **pathfinding (AStar)**  
- Start writing **unit tests** for movement  

### Q2 (Apr – Jun)  
- Develop **turn-based combat**  
- Implement **basic enemy AI**  
- Add **QTE mechanics** for attacks  

### Q3 (Jul – Sep)  
- Expand to **inventory and equipment** systems  
- Introduce **XP and skill progression**  
- Implement **simple dialogue interactions**   

### Q4 (Oct – Dec)  
- Polish the prototype  
- Add **party mechanics** (multiple unit control)  
- Finalize with **UI improvements** and **save/load** systems  

## Is This Realistic?  

I think so – as long as I:  
- **Keep the scope small** for the prototype  
- **Focus on one core system at a time**  
- **Leverage existing assets** (no need to reinvent the wheel)  
- **Work in small chunks** during weekends  

By focusing on these steps, I hope to have a playable prototype by the end of the year.  

## Why I’m Blogging This  

I plan to blog my progress weekly to hold myself accountable, but also to share what I learn along the way.  

Next week, I’ll start implementing my roadmap. I’m currently looking for public tracking software to list out my tasks and keep everything organized.
