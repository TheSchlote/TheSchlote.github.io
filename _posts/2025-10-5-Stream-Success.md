title: "First Stream Was a Huge Success!"

I mostly spent this week with my family, but I did get to help a bit with the **Moral Support Studios Tasks App**. I think the **Core**, **Auth**, and **Tasks** apps are getting close to the point where we can make them public soon! I'll post more updates once we decide on dates.

## Streaming Update

Friday night, I streamed **Digimon Time Stranger**, and I'd personally call it a huge success! We hit a maximum of **10 viewers**, and only **three** of them were my friends!  

I streamed for about **four hours**, broadcasting to both **Twitch** and **YouTube**. A buddy of mine has offered to help me edit the videos sometime soon, which should make for some great highlights.  

Tonight, I'm planning to stream again after my son goes to sleep. I'm also hoping to sneak in some shorter streams during weekday evenings as well.

## Follow Me!

If you'd like to watch or support the stream, you can find me here:

- YouTube: [@TheSchloteYT](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSchloteYT)  
- Twitch: [twitch.tv/TheSchlote](https://www.twitch.tv/theschlote)

Right now, I've got **2 subscribers on YouTube** and **9 followers on Twitch**. To reach **Twitch Affiliate**, I need **25 followers**, and YouTube requires **1,000 subscribers**-so there's a long way to go, but I think it'll be fun to grow over time!

## Looking Ahead

Watch my videos if you'd like! Someday, my dream is to make videos about **video game development**, but for now, I'm just having fun playing with my friends.  

I imagine this will always be a hobby of mine-and I'm okay with that.
