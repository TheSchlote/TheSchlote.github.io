# Big Changes and a Lot of Traveling  

Not much progress again this week—**but for good reasons**!  

I just got back from a **family trip to Branson**, and now I’m about to head out on another trip—this time to the **Bahamas** for a week. So yeah, not a lot of game development happening right now.

## A New Direction for Moral Support Studios  

Even though I haven’t been coding, I did have a **great meeting** with my friend, and we’ve decided to **rebrand Moral Support Studios**.  

- **Moral Support Studios** will now be **solely devoted to software development**.  
- **All video game-related projects** will now be branded under **TheSchlote** (which, obviously, is my username).  

This means I’ll be **slowly transitioning this blog** away from being Moral Support Studios-focused and shifting it toward **TheSchlote**. Realistically, my game dev work has **always** been a solo hobby, so this just **makes sense**.  

I imagine that work on my game will **slow down**, but **don’t worry**—I won’t let it stop completely.

## Our Plans for Moral Support Studios  

My friend and I really want to **turn Moral Support Studios into a business**—one that actually **makes money**, helps us **grow our skills**, and **supports other small businesses**.  

The plan:  
1. Start by making **small applications** for small businesses.  
2. Eventually, build a **Moral Support Studios Suite** of apps that small businesses can **pick and choose from**, using only what fits their needs.  

He’s also going to **rebrand the website** he’s been building for me to be **TheSchlote**, and once we have some apps under our belt, we’ll build a separate site for **Moral Support Studios**.

## Figuring Out This Blog’s Future  

Since I’ll be splitting my focus between **game dev** and **business software**, I’ll need to figure out a **good way to document** what I work on each week without making this blog feel all over the place.  

We’ll see how this blog grows, but I’ll keep posting and **finding a way to track my progress**—no matter what I’m working on that week!  

Exciting times ahead!
