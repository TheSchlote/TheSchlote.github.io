I've decided to rename the blog to **TheSchlote's Blog**. Originally, this was all about *Moral Support Studios*, but with everything going on, it makes more sense to separate my game dev work from the business side while keeping everything under one place.

## What's Changing
- All game dev work is under **Corrupted Virtues**.  
- All software/business-related work is under **Moral Support Studios**.  
- Still planning to post once a week, depending on what I get done.

This should keep everything organized without overcomplicating things. Just need to keep moving forward.
