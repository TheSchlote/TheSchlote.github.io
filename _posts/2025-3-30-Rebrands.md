# Rebrands, Razor Pages, and a Whole Lot of Moral Support

Big changes are in motion this week!

First off, I finally started rebranding the website. It’s not done yet, but progress is progress—and the ball is officially rolling.

On the Godot front... I opened the project, stared at it for a while, and closed it again. The goal is still to get the turn order UI implemented, but for now, my focus has shifted.

Why? Because **Moral Support Studios is in full swing!**

Nubchulubs12 and I officially kicked off our first app in the Moral Support Suite: **Moral Support Tasks**. It's a lightweight task and document manager for small business owners, and this first version is being built with **ASP.NET Razor Pages** and a **SQL Server backend**.

Naturally, we ran into a snag right out of the gate. I tried to host the project on GitHub Pages, which only supports static files. Razor Pages, being server-rendered, don't work in that environment. So that plan was scrapped.

No worries though—we’re pivoting. I should be getting my hands on an old Surface soon, and that’ll work as a temporary dev/test server while we get everything up and running.

More updates coming soon as we bring Moral Support to life, one app at a time.
