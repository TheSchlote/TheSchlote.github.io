# Conference and Growing Moral Support Studios

This past week, I spent my time traveling for a **Salesforce conference** for work. That meant **zero** code changes to my project.  

However, even though it was a Salesforce conference, it got me thinking a lot about my own **passions and aspirations**—specifically, my long-term goal of owning my own business. The conference was great, but it reminded me that I don’t want my career to be about championing **someone else’s** products. Someday, I want to **champion something I’ve made**.  

Whether that means starting my own **video game business**, selling **assets** to help others make games, or creating **something else entirely**, I don’t know yet—but I do know that I want to build **something of my own**.

## A Fresh Spark of Motivation  

When I got back from traveling, I had **another reason to celebrate**—one of my best friends graduated from **LaunchCode**! So, of course, we threw a graduation party for him. Naturally, the two of us ended up talking about our aspirations to **someday sell our own software products**.  

Now that we can work on projects **together**, I feel **reenergized** about Moral Support Studios—not just for making video games, but also for **SaaS products** and other **apps** that could help improve people’s lives.  

Right now, his first project is **building me a new website** for Moral Support Studios. My homework? **Finish a wireframe** for him to work from. Once that’s done, we’re going to start working on some **small apps together**—he’ll be learning **C#**, and in return, he’s going to help **me** with **unit testing**! I **can’t wait** to have someone to collaborate with again.

## Balancing Corrupted Virtues with New Projects  

Working on these projects **will** take some time away from **Corrupted Virtues**, but I told Nick that the best way for us to **quickly increase our productivity** is to **make LOTS of small things**.  

My biggest struggle has been **trying to make things too big**, and that’s just not realistic when we both have **families, full-time jobs, and other hobbies** outside of coding. That’s why I think it’s crucial for us to participate in **Game Jams** and **Hackathons**—quick, focused projects that push us to build and learn **fast**.  

Of course, I’m not giving up on **Corrupted Virtues**, but I’m **excited** to work on new projects with my friend as well! When I switch gears, I’ll need to figure out how to **keep blogging consistently** while making sure my posts don’t feel **confusing or jarring** as I move between different topics.  

Wish us luck!
