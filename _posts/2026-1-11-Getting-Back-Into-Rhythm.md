This week, **Nubchulubs12** and I had a few working sessions to move **Auth** forward. The main goal was making the `main` branch run locally again, and we are getting closer.

On the personal side, I have been putting time into my **Corrupted Virtues** campaign, and I started poking at the game again too. Mostly light experimenting with Codex for now, but I am excited to dive in deeper when life slows down.

**Exodus 90** workouts are underway. I have been starting at the YMCA with simple treadmill sessions: 12 incline, 30 minutes, 3 mph. It is a good baseline to build from.

I am also trying to get into the office more often so I can fit in my holy hour on the way in and call my anchors on the way home. That routine helps my sleep schedule, which is still a work in progress.
