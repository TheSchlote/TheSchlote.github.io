title: "Starting Exodus 90"

Last year was certainly a learning curve for my blogging. I started strong while focusing on my game, but pivoted when **Nubchulubs12** offered to help grow Moral Support into a business. Since then, consistency has been harder to maintain.

I know I’ve been pretty bad about blogging lately, but I still think it’s important to write when I can — even if it’s not perfect or consistent.

## Life Update

Tomorrow, I’ll be starting **Exodus 90** again. I’ve realized it’s a really effective way for me to reset habits and refocus, especially during major life transitions. I’m doing an Exodus 90 every time we have a new baby — it’s become a reliable mental and spiritual reset button.

## Moral Support & TheSchlote Progress

On the Moral Support side of things, **Nubchulubs12** and I have been working diligently on **Moral Support Studios**. Right now, our focus is getting **Auth** and **Core** deployed into a proper production environment using **Supabase** and **Fly.io**.

Honestly, ChatGPT Codex has been *very* clutch for figuring out CI/CD, environment configuration, and converting everything from running locally with SSMS to fully hosted, cloud-based setups. At the moment, I’m still ironing out some subdomain redirect issues, after which I’ll begin deploying Core.

One challenge that’s popped up is testing after deployment. Since Auth is no longer running locally, I’ll need to make some adjustments to my configuration to make testing workflows smoother.

## Looking Ahead

I also really want to get **TheSchlote** off the ground more this year. Our plan is for TheSchlote to be one of Moral Support’s first customers — which means I actually need to *release a game*.

To help with momentum, I’m planning to get a few friends together for a game jam this year. I also want to do a couple of solo jams just to force myself to finish and ship smaller projects. All of that will be happening alongside continued work on **Corrupted Virtues**, of course.

More soon — hopefully with fewer long gaps between posts.
