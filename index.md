Keeping this blog forces me to move forward a week at a time - whether it's shipping code, building Moral Support Studios, deepening my Catholic faith, or telling better stories at the tabletop.

## What you'll see here

- **Dev logs and architecture notes** for *Corrupted Virtues* and the Moral Support Suite.
- **Professional growth** from my day-to-day as a .NET developer and business co-founder.
- **Faith reflections** on how Catholic teaching shapes my work, priorities, and decision-making.
- **Twitch updates** when I stream builds, playtests, or just hang out: [twitch.tv/TheSchlote](https://www.twitch.tv/theschlote).
- **Dungeon Master prep** for the D&D campaigns I'm running, plus lessons learned from the table.

## The two big builds

1. **Corrupted Virtues** - a turn-based tactics RPG I'm rebuilding with more intention and testing discipline.  
2. **Moral Support Studios** - a web-based tools company I'm building with my friend **Nubchulubs12**, starting with a task app and growing into a suite for small businesses.

## Why I'm writing

- To stay accountable to steady, meaningful progress - personally and professionally.
- To share how faith, family, and craft fit together when time is tight.
- To leave a record of the wins, the stalled weeks, and the pivots that actually worked.
