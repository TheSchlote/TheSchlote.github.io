# Welcome to Moral Support Studios Blog!  

Hey there! I'm **TheSchlote** – Husband, Father, devoted Catholic, and a full-time .NET developer. I've got alot going on, but I'm passionate about bringing **Moral Support Studios** to life in the free time that I have!  

### Why I Made This Blog  
I'm hoping to share what I’m learning, document progress, and stay accountable along the way! My main project right now is **Corrupted Virtues**, an original fantasy concept I’ve been working on for years. I think it's really cool, and I hope you will too! 

This blog is my way to stay consistent, track milestones, and hopefully make steady progress toward my dream of making Moral Support Studios a reality.  

### What You’ll Find Here  
- **Game Dev Logs:** Progress updates on various side projects as I build skills and work toward publishing an RPG based on my original *Corrupted Virtues* concept.  
- **Game Jams:** I'll share experiences from participating in game jams, and everything I learn along the way.  
- **Helpful Resources:** Tools, tutorials, and references that I’ve found valuable.  
- **Weekly Progress:** I plan to post every week, even if it’s something small, if you don't see any updates feel free to check up on me!

### Why Moral Support Studios?  
Moral Support Studios is my creative outlet and a personal goal. I want to build something meaningful, and do it with my family and friends
