# TheSchlote's Blog

I'm TheSchlote - husband, father, Catholic, and a full-time .NET developer. Between work, family, and everything else, I'm carving out time to chase two projects that matter a lot to me: a solo game I've been building in my head for years, and a software business I'm launching with a close friend.

Keeping this blog helps me stay consistent, even if the steps are small. The plan is to make something meaningful over time-one week at a time.

## The Two Projects

1. **Corrupted Virtues** - My solo game dev project. A turn-based tactics RPG I've been working on for a long time.  
2. **Moral Support Studios** - The software company I'm building with my friend, **Nubchulubs12**, where we're developing web-based apps for small businesses.

The goal is to make steady progress every week, whether it's a breakthrough or just moving one thing forward.

## What I'm Logging Here

- **Corrupted Virtues Dev Logs** - Notes on development, mechanics, and worldbuilding.  
- **Game Jams** - Lessons from participating in jams.  
- **Moral Support Studios Updates** - Business and software development progress.  
- **Resources** - Anything useful worth remembering.  
- **Weekly Progress** - One post a week, depending on what I got done. If there's nothing to write about, that's a sign I need to get back to work.

## What is Moral Support Studios-

*Moral Support Studios* is the business my friend and I are building to create **useful software for small businesses**. Our long-term goal is to develop the **Moral Support Suite**, an ERP-style system where small businesses can mix and match the tools they need to run their operations.

The suite will eventually include:
- Task Management  
- Expense Tracking  
- Finance Management  
- Customer Management  
- Other core business functions  

Everything will be **fully web-based**, with no installs or outdated software. Just tools that work and scale with the user.

We're starting with a **task management app** as an intro project. Eventually, we also want to take on small development projects for other businesses who need custom software.

For me, this is about building something real with the skills I already have, leveling up as a developer, and helping others do the same.
